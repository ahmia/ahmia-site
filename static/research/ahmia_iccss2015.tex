% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

Tor is a software for anonymous TCP connections. This means that Tor enables anonymity to various Internet software. For instance, web servers can hide their location and web browsers can connect to these authenticated hidden services while the publisher and the viewer both stay anonymous. The publisher cannot be tracked down and the content cannot be censored. However, the research and measurements of hidden services is still thin. The aim of this paper is to introduce how we utilize our search engine implementation to understand hidden websites.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Using the Tor network, it is possible to run web servers anonymously and without fear of censorship \cite{tor}. Servers configured to receive inbound connections through Tor are called hidden services (HSs): rather than revealing the real IP address of the server, a hidden service (HS) is accessed through the Tor network by mean of a virtual top level domain .onion \cite{tor}.

In particular, we are interested in websites that operate as a hidden service. In this paper we call them hidden websites.

The published content is diverse \cite{contentanalysis}. Undoubtedly, some hidden websites are sharing pictures of child abuse, or operate as marketplaces for illegal drugs, including the widely known black market Silk Road. These few services are obviously controversial and often pointed out by critics of Tor and anonymity. On the other hand, vast number of hidden websites are devoted to human rights, freedom of speech, and information prohibited by oppressive governments.

Web search engines support finding web content. Because there were no search engines to search web content published using the Tor network, we built a working search engine for indexing, searching and cataloging content published inside the Tor network. Furthermore, we created an environment to share meaningful statistics, insights and news about the Tor network itself.

Ahmia provides the search and the access to hidden websites and believes that this is very important to the entire Tor network because we are efficiently enabling the diffusion and use of anonymous resources.

The whole search engine, Ahmia, is a free software and the source code is available online. This makes the research and our methods very transparent: Everyone is welcome to study our implementation.

In this paper we demonstrate how we can understand hidden service usage and how this reflects to our search engine design.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

\section{Related work}

\subsection{Tor2web}
Tor2web is an HTTP proxy for Tor HSs designed initially by Aaron Swartz \cite{aaron}. It aims at creating a network of proxies able to allow access to Tor HSs from the public internet. The software allows Tor hidden services to be reachable by means of a common browser and without the use of Tor client. Basically, it acts like a transparent proxy, translating the onion address into an HTTPS web URL \cite{tor2web}.

In order to support tor2web.org, we maintain the Tor2web.fi proxy that enables people to connect to the .onion TLD with a regular web browser by replacing .onion part with .tor2web.fi. For example, http://msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion can be accessed using http://msydqstlz2kzerdg.tor2web.fi.

\subsection{Access points to hidden websites}
There are several hidden website directories similar to the early development of the web when Tim Berners-Lee maintained a list of websites. These sites, such as multiple hidden wikis, are specialized in linking to other hidden websites and categorizing those links. In addition, there are few other search engines crawling hidden websites.

\subsection{Content and popularity analysis}
The popularity and content of hidden services has already been measured and researched \cite{contentanalysis}. To do this, hidden services addresses has been collected by running Tor relays, the services has been port scanned, and in the case of HTTP services the content have been analyzed. Furthermore, the popularity of hidden services has been measured by looking at the request rate for hidden service descriptors by clients. However, this method exploits Tor's design flaws and may cause privacy issues for hidden services. As such, it is not a sustainable way to measure the popularity and find hidden services.

The metrics measures the performance of the Tor network based on different data \cite{karsten}. Some of these data sources are not sensitive at all, like properties and capabilities of a relay. Others are more sensitive, like statistics on fetched directory listings by country. As a result, Tor Metrics measures and shares the data about number of clients, bridges, relays, bandwidth, performance and diversity. While having lots of statistics on the Tor network, Tor metrics is not offering any insight to hidden services and their content.


\section{Finding, ranking and understanding content}
First, the start point is to crawl the web content from the hidden services. Before that can be performed, a seed list of .onion domains has to exist. However, Tor technology does not offer a list of existing HSs.  Therefore, the first seed list was originally gathered from the sites that were listing .onion URLs.

Unfortunately, this method finds only those new .onion sites which are linked to those .onion pages which are already indexed. Moreover, only few hidden websites links to other hidden websites and there is no linking to every .onion. As a result, we cannot find all hidden sites. We visualized this problem by generating a SVG image of the crawling paths (see figure \ref{fig:onionlinking}). More visualizations material is available on https://ahmia.fi/static/visuals/.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{onionlinking.png}
  \caption{A part of the visualization  of the linking structure of hidden websites. Few sites gather lists of other .onion domains while the most of the sites have no linking to other .onion domains.}
  \label{fig:onionlinking}
\end{figure}

Another problem with current linking structure is that typical search ranking algorithms are based on linking between websites. Because the linking between hidden websites is thin, normal ranking algorithms perform poorly.

We would like to show a glance of the hidden website content in general. Ahmia produced a word cloud visualization of the front pages of hidden websites (see figure \ref{fig:wordcloud}).

Similarly, using the search index of hidden websites, we are locating malicious software sites to inform security firms, child pornography sites to filter them out,  and immediately after the international law enforcement operation, Operation Onymous, the list of sites seized by them.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{wordcloud.png}
  \caption{A word cloud that represents the most popular text content. These are the most common words on the front pages of hidden websites.}
  \label{fig:wordcloud}
\end{figure}

With the Tor2web software developers we introduced a HS discovery function to Tor2web software. This means that Tor2web is gathering a list of the visited .onion websites and the visit counts and search engines can download this list. In this way we can find new .onion domains and use their popularity information. This means that we can find new hidden websites and measure their popularity.

Moreover, very informative measurement is the total number of public WWW backlinks pointing to known hidden websites. We fetch this information automatically from the popular normal search engines.

These popularity metrics are illustrated in the figure \ref{fig:popularity}.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{popularity.png}
  \caption{The most popular websites according to average Tor2web proxy visits per day and the most popular websites according to number of backlinks from the public WWW.}
