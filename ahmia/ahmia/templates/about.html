          {% blocktrans %} Ahmia's mission is to create the premier search engine for services
              residing on the Tor anonymity network. In doing so, we hope to share meaningful
              statistics, insights, and news about the Tor network and the Tor
              project.

        <p>
          {% blocktrans %} Contributors to Ahmia believe that the Tor network is an important
              and resilient distributed platform for anonymity and privacy worldwide. By
              providing a search engine for what many call the "deep web" or "dark net", Ahmia
              makes hidden
              services accessible to a wide range of people, not just Tor network early
              adopters.
