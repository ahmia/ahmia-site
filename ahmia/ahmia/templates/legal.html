        Please 1. email us the exact URL of the content you suspect to be child abuse,
        and 2. <a href="https://www.pelastakaalapset.fi/en/our-work-in-finland/child-protection-and-finnish-hotline/report-illegal-content/">report anonymously through Save the Children Finland</a>.

      Updated policy in October 2023:
      There is now a filtering of all sexually related searchers.
      If the search contains these terms, then Ahmia.fi refuses to show the results.
      Instead, the search offers a link to a self-help programme.

      The self-help programme is primarily intended for people who are worried about their interests, thoughts, feelings, or actions concerning children.

      For example, &bdquo;jailbait&ldquo; is one of these filtered terms. As a result, Ahmia.fi is offering a link to a self-help programme:
      <a href="https://ahmia.fi/search/?q=jailbait">https://ahmia.fi/search/?q=jailbait</a>

      In addition, Ahmia applies an automated text mining algorithm to remove possible links to child abuse from the search results.
