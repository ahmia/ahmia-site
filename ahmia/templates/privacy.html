      Ahmia is a privacy-respecting search engine for publicly accessible Tor (.onion) websites.
      We explain in this policy what limited information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it—always protecting your anonymity.
      This Privacy Policy applies to all users of Ahmia, including its Tor and clearnet versions.
      For more details of functionality, refer to our <a href="/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.

      Please do not enter personally identifiable information into search terms or send personal data via email unless absolutely necessary and only with your explicit consent.

    <h4>{% trans "3. Right to Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten)" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia does not retain any identifiable user data. However, if you believe that a link indexed by Ahmia violates your privacy rights (e.g., links to harmful or defamatory content), you may submit a removal request under Article 17 of the GDPR.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Once we receive a valid request, we may process limited personal data to assess and respond to the request. We evaluate each case individually and may delist or lower the visibility of `.onion` URLs when justified under Finnish or EU law.
