      {% blocktrans %}
      These Terms of Service govern your use of the Ahmia search engine and apply to all users, including those accessing the Tor (.onion) and clearnet versions.
      By using Ahmia, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the service.
      Continued use of the service after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
      {% endblocktrans %}

    <h4>{% trans "1. What Does Ahmia Do?" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia is a non-commercial, privacy-focused search engine that indexes and displays links to publicly accessible `.onion` services on the Tor network.
      It provides keyword-based search functionality only. It does not host, upload, or distribute `.onion` content.
      Ahmia does not offer user accounts, personalization, or any form of interactive services.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia complies with online safety regulations and laws, including the UK Online Safety Act and the Australian Online Safety Act.
      Users can report harmful or illegal content.
      Ahmia actively filters search results and prevents search terms.
      In cases where users search for CSAM or any sexual content, Ahmia provides links to self-help programs or research surveys instead of showing results.
      The types of content that Ahmia filters may grow in the future as safety rules change and technology for finding harmful content gets better,
      all while keeping Ahmia's promise to protect user privacy and anonymity.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia may conduct user interface experiments, such as A/B tests, to evaluate how effectively help links or alternative search result views reach users, i.e., those seeking harmful content or high-risk terms.
      These tests may involve offering different layouts, messages, or redirect options on a randomized basis.
      The goal is to improve user engagement with educational or self-help resources while respecting user privacy.
      No identification of users is performed during these experiments.

      <strong>Digital Services Act (DSA) Statement:</strong>
      Ahmia is a small-scale, non-commercial academic project that processes approximately 1,715,358 searches per month,
      with the total number of unique users being significantly lower.
      It is designed with privacy-by-design principles and does not collect personal data, use cookies, or store IP addresses;
      thus, Ahmia cannot estimate the number of users beyond the search count.
      Most users access the service via the Tor Browser, making it technically impossible to determine their geographic origin or the number of EU-based users.
      No IP address data is available for the `.onion` version of Ahmia.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h4>{% trans "2. What You Agree Not To Do" %}</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>{% trans "Use Ahmia to search for, promote, or access illegal content, especially child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or sexually exploitative material." %}</li>
      <li>{% trans "Attempt to reverse-engineer, scrape, or replicate the service without permission." %}</li>
      <li>{% trans "Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the service or disrupt its normal functioning." %}</li>
      <li>{% trans "Violate any applicable laws of Finland or the European Union." %}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia implements automatic filters to exclude CSAM-related links and rejects associated search terms.
      Access may be limited or rate-restricted in cases of misuse.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h4>{% trans "3. Reporting Abuse" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      If you encounter content in Ahmia's index that violates the law or Ahmia’s ethical guidelines (e.g., CSAM or exploitation), report it by email to the maintainer.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia respects the Right to Be Forgotten under Article 17 of the GDPR.
      If an indexed `.onion` link violates your rights, including privacy, copyright, or personal safety, you may submit a request.
      Requests are evaluated case-by-case in accordance with Finnish and EU law.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h4>{% trans "4. Intellectual Property" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia does not host third-party content. All search results point to external `.onion` URLs.
      Ahmia indexes only publicly visible parts of `.onion` sites and is not responsible for their content.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      If content indexed by Ahmia infringes on your intellectual property rights, please contact us with sufficient evidence.
      We will review the request and may delist offending links.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h4>{% trans "5. No Warranty" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee the accuracy, legality, or safety of search results.
      We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or error-free operation of the service.
      Use of Ahmia is at your own risk.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h4>{% trans "6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      These terms are governed by the laws of Finland and applicable European Union regulations.
      Any disputes shall fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Finland.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <h4>{% trans "7. Privacy" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      Ahmia does not store personally identifiable information.
      There is no registration or login functionality.
      Users are advised not to enter personally identifiable information in search terms.

    <h4>{% trans "8. Updates to These Terms" %}</h4>
    <p>
      {% blocktrans %}
      We may update these Terms of Service as our research or technical infrastructure evolves.
      The most recent version will always be available on this page.
      All updates are recorded in a public <a href="https://github.com/ahmia/ahmia-site/blob/master/ahmia/templates/terms.html">GitHub changelog</a> for transparency.
      Continued use of the service after updates implies acceptance of the revised terms.
